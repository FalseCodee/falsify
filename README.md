# Legacy Client

little project I've worked on for a while. This project was private for a while, but I don't care enough about it anymore to keep it private. The client has a lot of features, some useful, some not. It's sort of an amalgamation of whatever ideas I got at the time. There are plenty of bugs in the client, but overall it's use-able.

Feel free to use or edit this as you want. Credit would be great but I would be a hypocrite if I didn't acknowledge that bits and pieces of this client were copied from who knows where. complete rips that I can remember are the font renderer and gif reader, but im sure there's a lot more im missing.

And no, the discord webhooks from old commits do not work you dirty dirty dog.
